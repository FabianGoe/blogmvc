**Example project with Slim Framework 3**

This is a small showcase of an application using [Slim Famework 3](https://www.slimframework.com/) for routing, dependency injection and 
using PSR-7 http interfaces. [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is used for rendering while [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/) is used for 
basic responsive page layouts.
